# Project raspberry-pico 

First development, aiming to automate fan speed depending on temperature.

## Description

Getting familiar with the hardware and software. Implementation of a python toolkit containing most useful methods. Concret use case prototyping: temperature driven 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Use ressources folder to get the necessary GUI (Thonny) as well as the binary


### Installing

1. Press the boot button on the rapsberry pico and plug in to computer
2. Copy the binary on the device
3. Use instructions from [Bibliography(2.)](https://www.electroniclinic.com/raspberry-pi-pico-rp2040-programming-in-micropython-with-examples/) to install modules if needed (OLED Display eg.)

### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
```
